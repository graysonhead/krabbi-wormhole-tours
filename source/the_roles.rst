The Fleet

Nestor
------

.. image:: images/Nestor.jpg

Nestors are the backbone of our Daytripping fleets, they provide logistical support, damage (via drones), and refit
capability.

Fitting
^^^^^^^


The following is the standard nestor fit:

.. code-block::

    [Nestor, Standard Nestor]
    Dread Guristas Drone Damage Amplifier

    Warrior II x5
    Hammerhead II x5
    Praetor II x10
    Curator II x7

    Tracking Speed Script x2
    Core Scanner Probe I x20
    Optimal Range Script x2
    Heavy Stasis Grappler II x1
    Core Probe Launcher II x1
    Improved Cloaking Device II x1
    Large EMP Smartbomb II x1



Please ensure that you have everything listed in the cargo. It is only acceptable to substitute these items:

 - Core Probe launcher T1 or Faction (This is more for saving your own ass if things go very wrong)
 - Cloaking device can be whatever you want
 - Large EMP Smartbomb can be Meta or Faction (longer range preferred)
 - Alternate Drone Loadout (See Below)

Please ensure you have the skills to use all other modules and drones.

During the course of a fleet, you may be asked to refit a Heavy Stasis Grappler, or Smartbomb. If asked:

 - Replace the `Drone Link Augmentor II` with the smartbomb
 - Replace one of the `Omnidirectional Tracking Link II` with the `Heavy Stasis Grappler II`

Minimum Skills
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to being able to use all modules, the following skills are required to ensure that
we can run sites in a timely and safe manner:


.. code-block::

    Amarr Battleship IV
    Gallente Battleship IV

In addition, the below skills are *highly* encouraged. Don't let these stop you from running a nestor,
but please ensure you are working on training them ASAP on your nestor characters:

.. code-block::

    Capacitor Emissions System V
    Advanced Target Management II

Alternate Drone Loadout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If desired, the drone layout can be changed to include Geckos, which have a higher overall damage output in combination
with medium and light drones. Use the above standard fit, but with this drone loadout:

.. code-block::

    Gecko x4
    Curator II x9
    Acolyte II x5
    Infiltrator II x5


This drone loadout increases the total cost of the nestor, but has some advantages:

 - Higher damage output against sleepers (~100dps)
 - Somewhat higher average damage output against drifters
 - Allows you to carry extra heavy drones and sentry drones in addition to lights and mediums

During PVE, you will launch the following in order to achieve the highest dps:

.. code-block::

    2x Geckos
    1x Infiltrator II
    2x Acolyte II

Eos
---

.. image:: images/Eos.jpg


The Eos serves as drone bunny as well as providing Armor Links. We run 1 Eos for every 10 Nestors due to
drone assist limits.

As with the Nestor, there are some modules that can be substituted:

    - Scan probe launcher/probes
    - Nosferatu can be Meta or T2
    - Cloaking device can be T1

.. warning::

    Beware that the Eos doesn't have the same probing bonus as the Nestor, so if you have bad scanning skills
    you may struggle to probe yourself out of wormholes with T1 Probes if you get stuck.
