How To Run Sites
================

Fleet Setup
-----------

Assuming everyone has familiarized themselves with the other sections of this manual,
fleet setup shouldn't take very long.

Step 1: Form a fleet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    - A minimum of two nestors should refit Grapplers.
    - A minimum of one nestor should refit a Smartbomb.
    - One Eos should be present for each 10 nestors

Decide who is performing the above roles, put that information in fleet MOTD

Step 2: Figure out Cap / Rep Chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All nestors should join the ``Nestors are the Bestor`` in game.

You will look at this channel, the person *below* you gets added to your watchlist. You will give this individual
two of your cap transfers and one of your remote reps.

The person *above you* will get added to your watchlist and you will give them one cap transfer and one remote rep.

You will then add your Drone Bunny to the watchlist, they will serve as your anchor.

Your spare rep will go to whomever broadcasts for armor.

.. note::

    In some circumstances, you may be expected to rub two braincells together and put more than one of your reps on a
    broadcast. Please prepare the requisite number of brain cells should this occur.

Step 3: Figure out Scram chain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The scram chain is like the cap chain, but the Eos are in it as well.

By default, always scram the person below you (the person you put two transfers on). If you are dualboxing a Nestor and
Eos, scram your Eos with the Nestor, and use the Eos to scram the person below you. Otherwise the Eos will have to
make friends and inject itself into the Scram chain somewhere.

If there is more than one Eos, they can scram each other.

Before running sites, its advisable to order scrams on, and try to fleet warp to see if anyone is a shitter before
running sites.


Step 4: ENSURE DRONES ARE PASSIVE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Everyone must set their drones to passive, otherwise triggers will be killed out of order and you will all die.

.. warning::

    Seriously, everyone needs to set their drones to passive.

A Handy Checklist Before Running Sites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: Text

    Assign two Grappler Nestors
    Assign one to two smartbomb Nestors
    Undock, test cap chain
    Call Scrams up, attempt fleet warp (no one should leave)
    Tell everyone to set their drones to passive
    Ensure Eos has at least 1.5k Command burst charges and an MTU


Step 5: Go Murder Sleepers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warp to site, get cap chain up, assist drones to drone bunnies, drone bunnies use target painters on sleepers, avoid shooting triggers:

(Trigger and wave info found here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_sites )

If PVP occurs, get scram chain up ASAP

Once the last wave of each site is dead, target paint the ``Uncloaked Transmission Relay`` to trigger the drifter
response battleship spawn. At this point all ships should approach the drifter and ensure at least two Nestors heavy scramble and Grappler it.
